        <h3 class="titleRules">SPORTSMANSHIP</h3>
        <p>
          The common interest that members of the Association share is to
          inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play.
          Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee
          whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary
          action regardless of technical hockey background, expertise,
          accomplishments or standing.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitleRules">IHF FIELD REGULATIONS</h3>
        <p class="parrafoRules">
          <strong> 1. DIMENSIONS. </strong> IHF Law 1 provides for flexible
          external field dimensions within a given maximum and minimum width and
          length. These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by
          teams under 12 and older.
        </p>
        <p class="parrafoRules">
          <strong> 2. COMPETITION FIELDS. </strong> Fields used within the
          competition program must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues,
          districts or associations participating in the state competition
          program that are unable to provide a field that meets these minimum
          requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will assign
          its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board
          whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted.
          Teams from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to
          provide an acceptable field may be required to play all their games
          away
        </p>
        <p class="parrafoRules">
